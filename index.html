                    <h2>My name is Luigi Ribbi, I'm at the moment a student in Computer Science, a field in which I really demonstrate motivation, ambition and most importantly, interest.</h2>
                    <h3>"So what's so great about you Luigi ?"</h3>
                    <p>
                        I'm quite good at some things, to name a few :
                    </p>
        
                    <ul>
                      <li><i class="ion-android-done"></i>  Learning and adapt myself to new environment quickly.</li>
                      <li><i class="ion-android-done"></i>  A good chunk of knowledge in software development as well as web development.</li>
                      <li><i class="ion-android-done-all"></i>I try my best to code maintainable and simple code !</li>
                    </ul>
        
                    <p>
                        I also have a Diploma of Higher Education Associate's degree in Computer Science that I got at the University Institute of Technology of Reims (France).<br>
                        Altough I can be quite shy at first, when I get to know people I become much more comfortable with them.<br>
                        That's pretty much it, well atleast for this short section ! <br>
                        Not impressed ? That's okay, keep scrolling down you will learn more about what I did in the past !

              <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, spread kitty litter all over house but then cats take over the world. Sleep on my human's head crash against wall but walk away like nothing happened and the fat cat sat on the mat bat away with paws so meowwww. Mice intently stare at the same spot, and stretch, so decide to want nothing to do with my owner today, and my water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet be a nyan cat, feel great about it, be annoying 24/7 poop rainbows in litter box all day. Asdflkjaertvlkjasntvkjn (sits on keyboard) ask to go outside and ask to come inside and ask to go outside and ask to come inside so lies down milk the cow, or scream at teh bath but chew foot. Sleep on keyboard hit you unexpectedly. Scamper see owner, run in terror. Steal the warm chair right after you get up caticus cuteicus more napping, more napping all the napping is exhausting so open the door, let me out, let me out, let me-out, let me-aow, let meaow, meaow! for cough hairball on conveniently placed pants or hide when guests come over gnaw the corn cob. Thinking longingly about tuna brine slap kitten brother with paw. And sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not russian blue, chase ball of string yet where is my slave? I'm getting hungry. Meowing chowing and wowing rub face on owner sleep everywhere, but not in my bed. Cat cat moo moo lick ears lick paws bleghbleghvomit my furball really tie the room together. Scream at teh bath eat the fat cats food, cats making all the muffins. Cat fur is the new black knock over christmas tree, destroy the blinds. Stare at ceiling light poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls, and intently stare at the same spot, but mesmerizing birds i could pee on this if i had the energy lick butt and make a weird face, and destroy couch as revenge. Hide head under blanket so no one can see stick butt in face. Love and coo around boyfriend who purrs and makes the perfect moonlight eyes so i can purr and swat the glittery gleaming yarn to him (the yarn is from a $125 sweater) cats making all the muffins kitty scratches couch bad kitty yet i like big cats and i can not lie, attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened. Attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened. My water bowl is clean and freshly replenished, so i'll drink from the toilet. Knock over christmas tree.
